# Image-classifier

This project involves building an image classifier using a custom model that resembles ResNet 50 and also employing transfer learning using a pretrained MobileNet network. 
Learning rate range test is employed to determine the apt learning rate.
Data augmentaion is used to regularize the model.
The models are trained with a train set of size 4000 images and validated on a validation set of size 1000 images.
